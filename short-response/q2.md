# Question

What are the benefits of single-page apps (SPAs) versus multi-page apps (MPAs)?

# Answer
Two benefits of SPAs versus MPAs is that they can be faster and more responsive since only neccesary parts of the site will be re-rendered. You can also maintain the state of your site more easily since there is no for a full reload to navigate throughout the page.
