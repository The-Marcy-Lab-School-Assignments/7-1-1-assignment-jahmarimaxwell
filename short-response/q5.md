# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer
The following paths that will match the /products/:id path are going to be the second and third option. `products/apple` and `/products/5` serve as the dynamic id value in the URL. Although apple is not a number, it can still be intepreted as an id. The first option automatically wrong because there is no additional segement after /products. Finally  the last option will not match because the path /products/:id is expecting the URL path to stop after the id segment. But `/products/5/about` goes beyond and has an additional segment so it cant be correct.
